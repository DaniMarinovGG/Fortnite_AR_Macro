# Fortnite_AR_Macro
This is a small python program that gives an unfair advantage by providing you with a NORECOIL for the brand new BALLISTIC weapon - the AR

:wrench: How to run it:
1.  Download the latest version of Python3 - link [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and complete the setup (it is easy)
2.  Once installed - open a new cmd on Windows or terminal on macOS/Linux and type: `pip install mouse pynput` (to install the necessary libraries) if for some reason it does not work - type `pip3 install mouse pynput` and if that does not work either ask chatGPT

:hammer: How to use:
1.  Open the file (preferably as an admin)
2.  To turn it on, press CAPS and to turn it off, press again CAPS
3.  When it is on you simply hold the LEFT CLICK (the button on your mouse you use to shoot)
4.  When it is off - nothing happens

:white_check_mark: It works on kernel level so it probably won't be detected by "Easy anti-cheat". Use it on your own risk - not 100% guaranteed. I dind't get banned so that is good. Cheat go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
